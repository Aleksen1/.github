Thanks for helping make GitHub safe for everyone ❤️

## Security

GitHub takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [desktop](https://github.com/desktop).

GitHub Desktop itself is part of [GitHub's bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/) and vulnerabilities should be reported there. The Desktop organization on GitHub also contains other open source repositories which may be outside of the scope of our bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/index.html#scope) and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards. Even if that's the case we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the current version of [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), please report it to us through our [bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/targets/github-desktop.html).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GitHub-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to opensource-security[@]github.com.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
